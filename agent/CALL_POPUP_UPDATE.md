# Call Popup Enhancement - Side Panel Design

## 🎯 Problem Solved
The previous call popup appeared as a **centered modal** that blocked the entire screen, preventing agents from accessing other features while on a call.

## ✅ Solution Implemented
The call popup now functions as a **minimizable side panel** on the right side of the screen, allowing agents to multitask during calls.

## 🎨 New Behavior

### **1. Incoming Calls (Full Screen)**
When a call comes in, the popup appears **centered on screen** with a backdrop:
- ✅ Forces agent attention for incoming calls
- ✅ Large answer/reject buttons
- ✅ Animated caller display
- ✅ Cannot be minimized (requires action)

### **2. Active Calls (Side Panel)**
Once a call is answered or placed, the popup moves to the **right side**:
- ✅ Positioned at top-right of screen
- ✅ Compact width (384px)
- ✅ Doesn't block main content
- ✅ Agent can navigate and work normally

### **3. Minimized Mode (Compact Bar)**
Agents can minimize active calls to a **small control bar**:
- ✅ Shows caller number and call duration
- ✅ Quick access to Mute, Hold, and Hangup
- ✅ One-click expand button
- ✅ Even more screen space

### **4. Keypad Mode (Side Panel)**
When opening keypad without a call:
- ✅ Appears on right side (not centered)
- ✅ Full keypad functionality
- ✅ Doesn't block workflow

## 🎮 User Controls

### **Minimize Button (⊟)**
- **Location:** Top-right corner (next to X button)
- **Action:** Collapses to compact bar
- **Available:** Only during active calls (not incoming)

### **Expand Button (⊞)**
- **Location:** Top-right of minimized bar
- **Action:** Restores full side panel

### **Close Button (X)**
- **Action:** Closes keypad or ends call

---

## 🎯 Benefits

### **For Agents:**
- ✅ **Multitask:** Access dashboard, notes, customer info during calls
- ✅ **Flexible:** Choose between full panel or minimized bar
- ✅ **Efficient:** Quick controls in minimized mode
- ✅ **Focused:** Incoming calls still demand attention

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### **Scenario 1: Taking Notes During Call**
1. Answer incoming call (centered)
2. Call automatically moves to right side
3. Navigate to Customer Timeline or Notes
4. Minimize call panel for more space
5. Take notes while talking
6. Expand to access call controls when needed

### **Scenario 2: Looking Up Information**
1. During active call, minimize the panel
2. Search knowledge base
3. Find answer
4. Expand panel to continue call

## 📱 How It Works

### **Incoming Call:**
- Appears **centered** with backdrop
- Full screen attention
- Must answer or reject

### **Active Call:**
- Moves to **right side** automatically
- Can minimize to compact bar
- Work on other tasks freely

### **Minimized:**

- Quick Mute/Hold/Hangup buttons
